# Follow up Questions
by Ryan James

## 1. Why do we multiply the value from step 5 above 4?
Because the coordinates are only averaged from one quadrant of a circle. 

## 2. What do you observe in the output when running your program with parameters of increasing size?
Each increased itiration brings the answer closer to PI.

## 3. If you run the program multiple times with the same parameter, does the output remain the same? why?
You get different results because the parameters are seeded by the current time and are random.

## 4. Find a parameter that requires multiple seconds of run time. What is that parameter? how accurate is the estimation?
I tried 150 million and it was accurate to 4 decimal places.

## 5. Research another use of the Monte Carlo method. Prepare to discuss it in class.
The monte carlo method can be used to calculate areas of shapes that aren't typical or easily defined.
